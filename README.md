# robbin-the-rich

This is a PyGame based game made in Python for a Programming module at University of Nottingham. Efforts by five other team members is recognised inside the game. 
To run the game, pull the code and run the RobbinTheRich.py file. A few packages might needed to be downloaded before the game runs properly. It was made on a Mac and optimised for the same. 
Refer to the console messages for errors and message if there is an unsolvable error. It should run almost perfectly (AFAIK, but extensive testing hasn't been done)

Have fun!
